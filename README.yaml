  This Terraform module contains the neccessary resources for creating a best-practices Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) setup in AWS.

  As per AWS best practices, a single VPC will be created with both public and private subnets, each subnet placed in a seperate availability zone. Each of the private subnets have their own private NAT gateway to allow internet access for resources hosted within the private zone of the network.
